# Similation_of_an_Amazon_order
# Java program that reads an order from a text file, turns it into a list of products, determine which products can be shipped now and which must be delayed until later, and then produce two reports –  one showing what will be shipped now, and one showing what portions of the order remain “on hold” for a later date.
